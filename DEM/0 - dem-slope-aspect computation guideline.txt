first, aggregate the DEM, from the 1arcsec native, to the desired resolution

THEN compute the respective resolution slope and aspect from those corresponding aggregated DEMs

DONT aggregate 1arcsec native resolution sloep and aspect values - its (most probably) meaningless

i will write new codes that do this procedure, right now its too chaotic
it works though, but eve i wiil forget how, because other parts require CLI, other to run a script...
the new codes will run the CLI coomands insode a respective script
