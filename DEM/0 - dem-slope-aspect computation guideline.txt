aggregate the DEM, from the 1arcsec native, to the desired resolution

aggregate 1arcsec native resolution sloep and aspect values - its (most probably) meaningless

computing slope and aspect from aggregated DEM spits out garbage, like aspect
values in the middle of the aegean sea, ill just aggregate the 1arcsec values i gues...

i will write new codes that do this procedure, right now its too chaotic
it works though, but eve i wiil forget how, because other parts require CLI, other to run a script...
the new codes will run the CLI coomands insode a respective script
