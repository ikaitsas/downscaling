Box-shaped artifacts in downscaled data often appear due to limitations in the spatial interpolation, data handling, or model structure during the downscaling process. Here's why they occur and how you can address them:

---

### **1. Causes of Box-shaped Artifacts**
#### a. **Resolution Mismatch**
- The low-resolution data is often represented as grid cells (boxes), and when these are downscaled, their spatial patterns are over-simplified or overly dependent on the original coarse grid structure.

#### b. **Poor Interpolation Techniques**
- Basic interpolation methods like bilinear or nearest-neighbor resampling fail to create smooth transitions between grid cells. These methods can reinforce the box-like structure of the input data.

#### c. **Model Overfitting to Input Data**
- If the model overly relies on the coarse-resolution data as input without effectively learning finer-scale patterns, the output retains the grid-cell structure of the input.

#### d. **Lack of Auxiliary Features**
- If the model does not use high-resolution ancillary data (e.g., topography, land cover), it may lack the spatial variability needed to produce smooth, realistic results.

#### e. **Inadequate Model Capacity**
- Simpler models (e.g., linear regression, shallow neural networks) might lack the capacity to effectively learn fine-scale spatial variability, leading to blocky outputs.

#### f. **Patch-based Training in Deep Learning**
- When using patch-based approaches in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), discontinuities at patch boundaries can create visible artifacts.

#### g. **Spatial Autocorrelation Issues**
- When coarse-resolution features dominate the model, the natural spatial correlation of the data might not be well-captured, causing artifacts.

### **2. How to Address Box-shaped Artifacts**
#### a. **Use Advanced Interpolation Techniques**
- Consider methods like bicubic interpolation, kriging, or spline-based interpolation to pre-process input data and smooth the coarse patterns.

#### b. **Incorporate High-Resolution Ancillary Data**
- Use features like elevation, land cover, or other fine-scale predictors to guide the model in learning finer details.

#### c. **Increase Model Complexity**
- Use advanced machine learning techniques:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** For spatial feature extraction and learning from neighboring pixels.
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** For super-resolution tasks, as they can generate more realistic textures and reduce blockiness.

#### d. **Improve Data Augmentation**
- When training, augment the data to introduce variability and reduce overfitting to the grid structure:
  - Random rotations, flips, and cropping can help the model generalize better.

#### e. **Apply Post-Processing**
- Smooth the output using Gaussian filters, wavelet transforms, or edge-preserving smoothing to eliminate blocky patterns.

#### f. **Enhance Spatial Regularization**
- Add regularization terms in the loss function to encourage smoothness or consistency across spatial boundaries (e.g., Total Variation Loss).

#### g. **Stitching Patches Smoothly**
- If using patch-based approaches:
  - Include overlapping patches during training and inference to minimize boundary discontinuities.
  - Use blending techniques to smooth the transitions between patches.

#### h. **Validate with High-Resolution Data**
- Use ground-truth high-resolution data to identify and correct sources of artifacts during training.

### **3. Monitoring and Debugging**
- **Visual Inspection:** Plot outputs to visually identify grid-like artifacts.
- **Error Metrics:** Use spatial metrics (e.g., structural similarity index or variograms) to quantify the smoothness and spatial coherence.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Ensure the model is not overly dependent on low-resolution features.
