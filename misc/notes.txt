- As of 2025-02-11, 
i have meteorological station data for the years 1960-2022, that are homogenized or not, daily and monthly.
i plan to use the years 1991-2020 as training-validation-testing datasets, and years 2021-2022 as downscaling 
candidates tha are to be validated with the nms data
i should change my data accordingly...
i also want to incorporate slope ans aspect to the model trainig, with the slope to be recomputed, using strips for the
correct assignment of the scaling factor in each one, and how to code aspect, especially for flat terrain...
i sould also see what i can do with land cover data, corine land cover does not seen too promising, because i cannot figure out
what the codes -128, 1, ..., 44, 48 represent, and how to merge codes (too many classifications for my case)
i will probably try land cover by CDS, and maybe NDVI and LST in the future...
