Yes, exactly! ðŸš€  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Approach**
1. **Compute Residuals**:  
   - Compute residuals at **coarse resolution**:  
     \[
     \text{Residual} = T_{\text{observed, coarse}} - T_{\text{predicted, coarse}}
     \]
   - These residuals represent the part of the temperature variability that the coarse model **failed to capture**.

2. **Upscale Residuals Smoothly**:  
   - Instead of simple **block replication**, apply **bilinear interpolation** to spread residuals **smoothly across the high-resolution grid**.  
   - This **removes blocky artifacts** and creates **natural-looking transitions**.

3. **Train a Residual Model Using Fine-Scale Covariates**:  
   - Use the **interpolated residuals** as the target.  
   - Train a model (e.g., **Extra Trees**) using **high-resolution terrain features** like:  
     - **High-resolution elevation**  
     - **Land use classification**  
     - **Aspect, slope, curvature**  
     - **Latitude, longitude**  

4. **Apply Residual Model for Final Downscaling**:  
   - First, predict **high-resolution temperatures** using the coarse model.  
   - Then, **correct** them using the trained residual model.  

\[
T_{\text{final, high-res}} = T_{\text{predicted, coarse (upscaled)}} + \text{Residual Model Correction}
\]

### **ðŸ”¹ Why Bilinear Interpolation?**
âœ… **Removes sharp edges** â†’ Smooths transitions across coarse-grid boundaries.  
âœ… **Preserves large-scale trends** â†’ Does not introduce artificial noise.  
âœ… **Better model learning** â†’ The residual model can learn **true fine-scale patterns** rather than blocky artifacts.
